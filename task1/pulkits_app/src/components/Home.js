          Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Pulkit, a passionate college student based in Delhi, India. I'm excited to showcase my skills and projects to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a web developer, I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that provide a great experience to visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience working with various frontend frameworks and libraries, including ReactJS. I love the flexibility and efficiency that ReactJS offers in building interactive and dynamic web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, and expanding my knowledge in the field. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to browse through my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities. I'm looking forward to connecting with you!

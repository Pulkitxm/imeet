        <p>
          Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pulkit, a passionate college student based in Delhi, India. Welcome to my profile!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong affinity for technology and a keen interest in web development and programming. Over the years, I have acquired a diverse skill set that includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and frontend development. I have also worked on multiple frontend projects using these technologies, showcasing my ability to bring designs to life and create engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my frontend expertise, I have also ventured into Python and Java, where I have successfully completed projects that demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and programming proficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a lifelong learner, I am always exploring new areas and expanding my knowledge. Currently, I am focusing on enhancing my skills in JavaScript, specifically ReactJS, and planning to learn about DevOps practices, which I believe will further augment my abilities as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a range of hobbies that keep me engaged and inspired. Whether it's reading books, playing sports, or exploring the outdoors, I find that these activities provide a well-rounded perspective and fuel my creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a firm believer in collaboration and teamwork. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to meaningful projects. I enjoy taking on challenges, leveraging my skills, and working towards innovative solutions.
        </p>
